# 🧪 Exercise 1: Build Your Own Mini Website
Create a simple website similar to the Ice Cream Paradise example.
But this time, use your own theme! Be creative and choose something you're excited about, such as:

📚 Book Shop

🐾 Pet Shop

👟 Shoe Store

or anything you personally love!

🎨 Step 1: Sketch First
Before you start coding, sketch your layout first using this tool:

Draw the structure of your page — for example: header, menu, product cards, and footer. This will keep you focused and help you avoid confusion during coding.

💻 Step 2: Build the Website
Create a folder for your project (e.g., book-shop, pet-store, etc).

Inside the folder, create:

index.html

style.css

Link your CSS in the HTML using:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

Your Website Should Include:
✅ A header with a welcome message

✅ A navigation menu

✅ At least 2 product cards (image, title, description, price)

✅ A unique color scheme and typography

✅ A footer

💡 Bonus Points If You:
Use Google Fonts

Make the layout responsive with media queries

Add hover effects to buttons/images

Add a Contact Us section with a simple form

🤖 Using AI Wisely
Do NOT rely on AI right away.

Try building everything by yourself first — this is how you actually learn.
But if you feel stuck or frustrated for more than 1 hour, feel free to use AI to help you move forward.
Use AI as a support tool, not a crutch.

🚀 Final Submission
Push your project to GitHub (or share your project folder).
Make sure your HTML and CSS files are clean and well-structured.

✨ The more effort and originality you put into this project, the more rewarding it will be.
